## IdealAQ
A range of projects done for a university spin off [IDealAQ](https://idealaq.com/).

[//]: # (### AQrpi)

### Master thesis
As my master thesis topic I chose problems I faced during designing and developing an IoT platform for this project.

The thesis focused on the problems related to using the right architecture for processing high velocity data generated by IoT devices. The requirements contained the need for near-real-time data visualisation and querying large amounts of historic data for further processing and analysis. 

### AQvis
[ [more](./projects/AQvis.md) ]

Data visualisation web application.

**FastAPI, React, AWS, Terraform**

### AQrpi
[ _source code presented personally on request - **private repository**_ ]

Hardware control software for a custom and patented **condensation particle counter (CPC)**.

The software reads data from and controls hardware components using SPI, I2C, GPIO and serial interface.

> The software uses various design patterns to provide flexibility in the use of different hardware components from different manufacturers. Change of the component in the most cases requires only change of a configuration file in YAML format.
